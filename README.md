# pipeKV stream 

A minimal pipeline for segmenting, uploading, and streaming video content using Pipe Network’s KV storage — fully operated from a PoP node.

The system is split into:
- **Backend**: Bash + FastAPI (runs on pop-node server | VPS)
- **Frontend**: PHP + HLS.js player (served from a public web host)

---

## ⚙️ Overview

```
[Your PoP Node Server]
     |
     | (1) Upload .mp4 to server
     v
  [ts.sh script]
     |
     | (2) ffmpeg → segment into .ts + .m3u8
     | (3) Upload to Pipe KV (need X-Service-Key)
     v
[PoP KV Storage]
     ^
     | (4) Fetch via FastAPI proxy (/m3u8 + /ts)
     v
[HLS.js Player]
```

### How it works

- The operator uploads an `.mp4` file directly to PoP node
- A bash script (`ts.sh`) segments the video and uploads all files to Pipe KV
- The `.m3u8` playlist is auto-patched to route segments via a FastAPI proxy
- A secure `/m3u8` and `/ts` proxy serves the content back to the browser
- The frontend player (PHP + HLS.js) streams everything directly from Pipe KV

## Components

### in PoP Node (VPS)

* `ts.sh`
  a Bash script that segments `.mp4` files into `.ts` chunks and a `.m3u8` playlist using `ffmpeg`,
  then uploads all segments and the playlist to Pipe KV using your PoP node credentials.
  → Before running, make sure to **create a `.env` file** with the following content:

  ```
  X_SERVICE_KEY=your-key-from-pop_state.json
  ```

  → You can find your `X-Service-Key` in the `.pop_state.json` file, usually located in `/opt/popcache/`.

  → The upload destination defaults to `https://127.0.0.1`, assuming your FastAPI proxy is running locally. You can adjust this via the `HOST` variable in the script if needed.


* `pipe_api.py`
  A FastAPI server that acts as a secure proxy for:

  * `/m3u8/{filename}` → HLS playlists
  * `/ts/{filename}`   → video segments

  It includes:
  * Origin/Referer validation
  * Protection against path traversal
  * CORS restrictions to only allow your frontend domain

  → This script also uses the `.env` file. Set it up like this:

```
# Required PoP Node Service Key (used to access Pipe KV)
X_SERVICE_KEY=

# Allowed domain for CORS (frontend/player domain)
ALLOWED_REF=https://yourfrontend.domain
  ```

---

### Web Hosting (Frontend)

- `player.php` 
This is a simple HLS.js-based video player that streams `.m3u8` playlists and `.ts` segments from your own PoP node’s FastAPI proxy.
#### Modify Proxy URL in `player.php`
By default, the script points to:
```php
$m3u8_url = "http://127.0.0.1:6969/m3u8/" . rawurlencode($filename);
```
Replace `http://127.0.0.1:6969` with your own PoP node domain or IP that runs the FastAPI ingest server (must be public-facing):
```php
$m3u8_url = "http://your-node-ip-or-domain:6969/m3u8/" . rawurlencode($filename);
```

- `index.php`  
  Displays the available playlists listed in `m3u8_index_cache.json`.  
  When clicked, redirects to `player.php`.

- `m3u8_index_cache.json`  
  Automatically generated by `ts.sh` (in VPS `./video/` directory).  
  Must be copied to the frontend host for `index.php` to display available streams.

## USAGE

###  Setup in your PoP Node server (VPS)

#### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install screen ffmpeg python3-venv jq build-essential -y
````

#### 2. Create virtual environment & install Python requirements

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi httpx uvicorn python-dotenv uvloop httptools
```
> `uvloop` and `httptools` improve performance and require `build-essential` to compile.

---


#### 3. Launch FastAPI proxy using screen

```bash;
screen -S pipeapi
uvicorn pipe_api:app \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 6969 \
  --workers 2 \
  --loop uvloop \
  --http httptools
```

> Use `Ctrl+A, D` to detach the screen session.
> To reattach later, use `screen -r pipeapi`.

---

⚠️ **If your frontend uses HTTPS (SSL), you must launch Uvicorn with SSL certs to avoid browser blocking due to mixed content:**

```bash
uvicorn pipe_api:app \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 6969 \
  --ssl-keyfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem \
  --ssl-certfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem \
  --workers 2 \
  --loop uvloop \
  --http httptools
```

> Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.
> Required if your HLS player is loaded over `https://`.

---

#### 4. Upload and process video

```bash
./ts.sh your_video.mp4
```

This will:

* Segment the video using `ffmpeg`
* Rewrite `.m3u8` to use `/ts/` proxy paths
* Upload segments and playlist to Pipe KV
* Update `m3u8_index_cache.json` under `./video/`

> Make sure to copy `m3u8_index_cache.json` to your PHP web hosting for the playlist list to work in `index.php`.

---

### Workflow

1. User downloads video.mp4 to the PoP node server (can use scp, wget, curl, or any preferred method)
2. PoP server receives file → splits with ffmpeg → uploads segments to KV
3. `.m3u8` generated and returned to browser
4. HLS.js streams content from Pipe KV via fastapi

## Why This Project?
This project explores real-time video delivery via Pipe KV, showing how PoP nodes can act both as uploaders and content routers.
